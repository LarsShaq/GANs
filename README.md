## What is a GAN?
A General Adversarial Network is a method for approximating the underlying distribution of some data. So for example if you have a lot of images of cats, which is some kind of a distribution, a GAN would try to produce images of cat. The goal at the end is that you can't distinguish the "fake" images created by the GAN from the real images. 

## What is the main principle of a GAN


# Generative Adversarial Nets 
This was the classic paper introducing GANs by Ian Goodfellow. It stated the idea of using a Generator and a Discriminator playing a min-max Game for the first time.
